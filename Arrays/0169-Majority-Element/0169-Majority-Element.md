## 169. Majority Element (Easy)

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`. Your task is to find and return the **majority element** in the array.

The majority element is defined as the element that appears **more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times** in the array. You may assume that such an element **always exists** for the given input.

### Example 1

**Input:** `nums = [3,2,3]`
**Output:** `3`

### Example 2

**Input:** `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`
**Output:** `2`

### Constraints

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
* `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* The input is generated such that a majority element will always exist in the array.

### Follow-up

Can you solve the problem in **linear time O(n)** and using **constant space O(1)**?
