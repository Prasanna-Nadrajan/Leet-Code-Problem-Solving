# 724. Find Pivot Index (Easy)

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the pivot index where the sum of all elements strictly to the left equals the sum of all elements strictly to the right.

If the pivot index is at the leftmost position, the left sum is considered `0`. Similarly, if it is at the rightmost position, the right sum is considered `0`.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return `-1`.
