## 🚀 Day 90 – Remove Duplicates In-Place: Array Cleanup Time! 🧹🧠

Today’s LeetCode challenge was all about **cleaning up duplicates from a sorted array** — but with a twist: it had to be done **in-place**, without using extra memory. 🔁

### 🔍 Challenge: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (LeetCode #26)

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a **sorted array**, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.  
Return the number of unique elements (`k`) and ensure the **first k elements** of the array hold the result.

📥 **Examples:**

- Input: `[1,1,2]` → Output: `2`, Updated: `[1,2,_]`  
- Input: `[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]` → Output: `5`, Updated: `[0,1,2,3,4,_...]`

### ✅ Key Learnings:

- 🔁 Used the **two-pointer technique** to compare and shift values in-place  
- 🧠 Solidified my understanding of **in-place array updates**  
- ⚡ Great practice in minimizing space while preserving order

📂 **Category**: Arrays  
💡 **Skills Applied**: Two-pointer, space optimization, in-place mutation
