# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topics:** Prefix Sum, Array

## Problem Statement

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts the trip at point `0` with an altitude of `0`.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n`, where `gain[i]` represents the net gain in altitude between points `i` and `i + 1`.

Return the **highest altitude** of a point during the trip.

## Examples

**Input:** `gain = [-5, 1, 5, 0, -7]`
**Output:** `1`

**Input:** `gain = [-4, -3, -2, -1, 4, 3, 2]`
**Output:** `0`

## Constraints

* `1 <= gain.length <= 100`
* `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`
