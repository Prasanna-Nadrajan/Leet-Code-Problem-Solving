# 392. Is Subsequence

**Difficulty:** Easy

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, otherwise return `false`.

A subsequence is formed by deleting some characters from the original string without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

### Constraints

* 0 <= s.length <= 100
* 0 <= t.length <= 10^4
