# 735. Asteroid Collision (Medium)

You are given an array of integers `asteroids` representing asteroids moving in a straight line. The index represents the relative position of each asteroid.

The absolute value of an asteroid represents its size, while the sign represents its direction (positive → right, negative → left). All asteroids move at the same speed.

When two asteroids collide, the smaller one explodes. If both are the same size, both explode. Asteroids moving in the same direction will never collide.

Return the final state of the asteroids after all collisions.
