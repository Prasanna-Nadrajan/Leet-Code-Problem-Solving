🧠 Day 88 – Matching Brackets with Stack Power! 🧱📚

Today’s challenge on LeetCode took me back to a **classic DSA problem**: validating parentheses!  
Simple to understand — but requires precision in logic and structure. ✅

🔍 **Challenge:** *Valid Parentheses*

📄 **Problem Statement:**  
Given a string `s` consisting only of `'(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'`, determine if the brackets are closed **in the correct order** and **by the correct type**.

📥 **Examples:**
- Input: `"()"` → ✅ Output: `true`  
- Input: `"()[]{}"` → ✅ Output: `true`  
- Input: `"(]"` → ❌ Output: `false`  
- Input: `"([])"` → ✅ Output: `true`

✅ **Key Concepts Learned:**

🧱 **Stacks are perfect** for tracking open-close operations.  
🔁 Pushed open brackets, popped on matching closing ones.  
🚫 Any mismatch or leftover brackets = invalid input.

📂 **Category**: Stacks  
🧠 **Skills Applied**: Stack operations, character scanning, condition logic.

✨ **Reflection:**
Brackets may look tiny, but they demand **structural integrity** — just like good code.  
Day 88 reminded me how foundational data structures like stacks are still essential to solving real-world problems. 🔁💡
