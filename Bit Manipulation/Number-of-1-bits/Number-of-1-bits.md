## ðŸ§  Problem Statement: Number of 1 Bits (Hamming Weight)

Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation. This count is also known as the **Hamming weight**.

### ðŸ§ª Examples

**Example 1**  
Input: `n = 11`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: The binary representation is `1011`, which has 3 set bits.

**Example 2**  
Input: `n = 128`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: The binary representation is `10000000`, which has 1 set bit.

**Example 3**  
Input: `n = 2147483645`  
Output: `30`  
Explanation: The binary representation is `1111111111111111111111111111101`, which has 30 set bits.
