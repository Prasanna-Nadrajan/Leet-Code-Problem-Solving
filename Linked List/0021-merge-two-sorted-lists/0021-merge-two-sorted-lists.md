## 🧠 Day 89 – Merging Minds: Sorted Linked Lists Unite! 🔗📊

Today’s challenge on LeetCode was a classic one — merging two **sorted linked lists** into one sorted list, node by node.  
It’s not just about combining — it’s about preserving order with precision and care. 🧬

### 🔍 Challenge: Merge Two Sorted Lists

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.  
Merge them into one sorted list and return the head of the new list.

📥 **Examples:**
- Input: `[1,2,4]`, `[1,3,4]` → ✅ Output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`  
- Input: `[]`, `[]` → ✅ Output: `[]`  
- Input: `[]`, `[0]` → ✅ Output: `[0]`

### ✅ Key Learnings:

- 🔄 Used two pointers to traverse both lists and compare nodes.  
- 🔗 Created a dummy node to build the new list efficiently.  
- 🧠 Great practice in working with **pointers and node manipulation**.

📂 **Category**: Linked List  
💡 **Skills Applied**: Two-pointer technique, list traversal, dummy nodes

### ✨ Reflection

Day 89 reminded me how elegant linked list problems can be.  
Every node matters, and every connection is intentional — just like in real-world systems. 🧠⚙️
