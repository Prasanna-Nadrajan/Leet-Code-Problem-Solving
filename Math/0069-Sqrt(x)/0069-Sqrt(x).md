## 🧮 Problem: Sqrt(x) (LeetCode #69)

### 📄 Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the **square root of `x` rounded down** to the nearest integer.  
The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You **must not** use any built-in exponent function or operator.

> ⚠️ For example, do **not** use `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python.

### 📥 Examples

#### Example 1:
    Input: x = 4  
    Output: 2  
    Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

#### Example 2:
    Input: x = 8  
    Output: 2  
    Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and we round it down to 2.
