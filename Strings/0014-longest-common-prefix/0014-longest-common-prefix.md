## 🚀 Day 87 – Expanding Horizons: LeetCode Joins the Journey! 🌍💻

After 86 productive days growing on **HackerRank**, I'm now branching out to **LeetCode** for a wider variety of challenges and deeper DSA exploration — while still keeping HackerRank in the loop for practice! 🧠💪  
It's not a switch — it's an upgrade in versatility. 🔄📈

### 🔍 Today’s Challenge: **Longest Common Prefix**

**Problem Statement:**  
Write a function to find the **longest common prefix string** among an array of strings.  
If there’s no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

📥 **Input Example 1**: `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`  
✅ **Output**: `"fl"`

📥 **Input Example 2**: `["dog", "racecar", "car"]`  
✅ **Output**: `""`

### ✅ Key Learnings:

🔡 Mastering prefix logic sharpens understanding of string alignment and early termination.

🧠 Compared characters column-by-column instead of string-by-string — simple yet powerful.

📂 **Category**: Strings  
💡 **Skills Applied**: Character comparison, prefix trimming, loop control.

### ✨ Reflection

LeetCode brings in new styles of questions, test case rigor, and ranking systems — and I’m excited to grow through both platforms now.  
Day 87 showed that learning is never platform-bound — it's about momentum and mindset. Let’s keep it going! 🚀🔥
