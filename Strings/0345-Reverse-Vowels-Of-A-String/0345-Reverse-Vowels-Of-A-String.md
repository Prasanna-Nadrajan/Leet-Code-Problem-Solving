# 345. Reverse Vowels of a String

**Difficulty:** Easy  

Given a string `s`, reverse **only the vowels** in the string and return the resulting string.  
All non-vowel characters must remain in their original positions.

Vowels include both lowercase and uppercase characters:  
`a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U`

### Example
**Input:**  
`s = "IceCreAm"`

**Output:**  
`"AceCreIm"`

### Explanation
The vowels in the string are `I, e, e, A`.  
Reversing only these vowels while keeping other characters fixed gives the final result.

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
- `s` consists of printable ASCII characters
